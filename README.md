The project started as a weekend hack by [David Lago](https://twitter.com/dave_lago), [Geoffrey Litt](https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt), and [Radhika Malik](https://twitter.com/radhika1990) for [CodeAcross Boston 2015](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/codeacross-boston-2015-tickets-15442437747).
The site is built using Meteor.js and Materialize.css, and deployed on Heroku.
